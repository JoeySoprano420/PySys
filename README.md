# PySys

### **Overview of Current Progress**

The goal is to create a **cumulative-learning iterative-procedural compiler (C.L.I.P. Compiler)** for a superscript of Python that is optimized for low-level dominance, using **MSVC**, **NASM**, and **Python 13+**. We've been moving through the design and implementation stages, focusing primarily on the **lexical analysis** part of the compiler development, with careful attention to ensure we can handle low-level constructs, without relying on external dependencies like LLVM, g++, or MLIR.

Here's what we've accomplished so far:

---

### **1. High-Level Architecture**

The compiler is designed to be modular and efficient, with **low-level dominance** being a key focus. The idea is to allow Python-like syntax with low-level control, making it suitable for systems programming, embedded systems, and scenarios where direct memory management and performance are paramount.

---

### **2. Lexical Analysis (Lexer)**

We’ve implemented the **lexical analysis** stage, which involves breaking down the source code into meaningful chunks or **tokens**. These tokens are the building blocks for subsequent stages of the compiler (parsing, optimization, and code generation).

#### **Tokens Defined So Far:**

1. **Keywords (Reserved Words)**:
   - A list of essential keywords like `int`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `void`, `true`, `false`, `struct`, `typedef`, etc.
   
2. **Identifiers**:
   - Tokens that match variable names, function names, class names, etc. They start with letters or underscores and may contain digits.

3. **Operators**:
   - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.
   - Logical: `&&`, `||`, `!`, etc.
   - Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.
   - Bitwise: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, etc.
   - Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.
   - Increment/Decrement: `++`, `--`

4. **Delimiters**:
   - These tokens include common symbols used for structure, such as `()`, `{}`, `[]`, `;`, etc.

5. **Literals**:
   - Numeric literals (both integer and floating-point), string literals, character literals, boolean literals, and `null`.

6. **Data Types**:
   - Basic types like `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, etc.

7. **Comments**:
   - Single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments to ensure proper skipping during tokenization.

8. **Whitespace**:
   - Spaces, tabs, and newlines are handled and ignored during tokenization.

9. **Punctuation**:
   - Basic punctuation marks like commas and periods for structuring code.

10. **Special Tokens**:
    - Special characters that may be used for specific extensions or features, such as `@`, `$`, and `&`.

#### **Regular Expressions for Tokens:**
To match these tokens, we have defined **regex patterns** that correspond to each category. For example:
- **Keywords**: A word boundary match for predefined language keywords.
- **Identifiers**: Matching any sequence of characters that starts with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
- **Operators**: Various regex patterns to match arithmetic, logical, and assignment operators.
- **Literals**: Regex patterns to match numeric, string, and boolean literals.
- **Comments**: Matching both single-line and multi-line comments.

---

### **3. Tokenization Process**

We’ve written a **tokenizer** function that takes the source code as input and returns a list of tokens. The process is as follows:
1. **Reading the source code**: The code is parsed from the beginning to the end, character by character.
2. **Matching tokens**: At each step, the lexer tries to match the current character sequence against the regular expressions for different token types.
3. **Skipping invalid characters**: If a match is found, it’s added to the list of tokens, and the lexer moves forward. If no match is found, a syntax error is raised.
4. **Handling whitespace**: Whitespace is ignored during tokenization, and only meaningful tokens are collected.

---

### **4. Sample Input/Output**

For the input source code:
```python
int main() {
    int x = 42;
    if (x == 42) {
        x++;
    }
}
```

The lexer generates the following tokens:
```plaintext
[('KEYWORD', 'int'), ('IDENTIFIER', 'main'), ('DELIMITER', '('), 
('DELIMITER', ')'), ('DELIMITER', '{'), ('KEYWORD', 'int'), 
('IDENTIFIER', 'x'), ('ASSIGN', '='), ('NUMBER', '42'), 
('DELIMITER', ';'), ('KEYWORD', 'if'), ('DELIMITER', '('), 
('IDENTIFIER', 'x'), ('COMPARISON', '=='), ('NUMBER', '42'), 
('DELIMITER', ')'), ('DELIMITER', '{'), ('IDENTIFIER', 'x'), 
('INCREMENT_DECREMENT', '++'), ('DELIMITER', ';'), ('DELIMITER', '}'), 
('DELIMITER', '}')]
```

---

### **5. Next Steps in Development**

We are currently at the **lexical analysis** phase, where the goal is to ensure that the lexer can correctly identify all meaningful components of the source code. 

The next steps are:
1. **Parsing**: Once the tokens are generated, the next step is to parse them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or some other internal representation.
2. **Handling Errors**: We will need to ensure that invalid tokens or unexpected sequences of characters result in meaningful error messages to guide the developer.
3. **Optimization**: Consider adding optimization features, like removing unnecessary tokens or simplifying expressions early on.
4. **Code Generation**: Convert the AST into assembly code or machine code using **NASM** and **MSVC**, and generate executables for the target platform.

---

### **Conclusion**

So far, we’ve built a solid foundation by defining key language constructs and setting up the tokenization process. With the lexer now handling the identification of a broad array of tokens, we are ready to move towards parsing, code generation, and other advanced features as we continue developing this compiler.


Creating an **Imperial Superior Evaluation System** (ISES) involves designing a high-level approach to convert written code into **machine-executable keys, commands, instructions, and comments**. This system aims to **scrutinize** the code, optimizing it for execution and ensuring that each part of the code is transformed into highly intuitive and efficient machine instructions. Below is an outline of how this system can be developed and the processes involved.

---

### **1. Overview of the Imperial Superior Evaluation System (ISES)**

ISES is a sophisticated compiler or evaluator that transforms human-readable code into optimized, **machine-specific** commands. This transformation process ensures not only the conversion into executable instructions but also generates **helpful annotations** or **comments** for ease of understanding and debugging.

The system is built on several key features:
1. **Intuitive Key Mapping**: Turns complex code into machine-executable keys that are instantly understood by the system.
2. **Command Optimization**: Simplifies operations, ensuring the system executes them most efficiently.
3. **Instruction Breakdown**: Divides each operation into its smallest, most efficient component and maps it to machine instructions.
4. **Comment Generation**: Automatically generates detailed comments explaining what each part of the code is doing, at both high and low levels.

---

### **2. Key Concepts**

#### **A. Code Scrutiny & Deconstruction**

The system begins by analyzing the code to break it down into its constituent **logical parts**. It works by identifying:
- **Functions** (functions, methods, or procedural blocks)
- **Variables** (and how they interact with each other)
- **Control Flow** (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- **Resource Management** (memory usage, I/O operations)
  
Once the components are identified, the system moves to the optimization and transformation stages.

---

#### **B. Machine-Executable Keys & Commands**

ISES needs to translate each logical part into **machine-executable components**. Here's how this can be handled:
1. **Key Mapping**:
    - Each line or block of code gets mapped to machine-optimized **keys** (e.g., registers, flags, system calls).
    - The system utilizes predefined mappings for high-level operations like loops, conditionals, and function calls.
    
    **Example**: If a function in Python is `x = a + b`, the system might map that to machine-level assembly commands or a custom bytecode representation.
    
    ```asm
    ; Pseudo-assembly for x = a + b
    MOV R1, a     ; Load a into register R1
    ADD R1, b     ; Add b to register R1
    MOV x, R1     ; Store result in x
    ```

2. **Command Generation**:
    - Commands are generated to define how resources like memory, registers, and threads are allocated.
    - **Optimization rules** help determine the most efficient commands to reduce the number of operations or instructions needed.

    **Example**: A memory allocation command might be mapped to an efficient machine instruction that allocates memory on the stack or heap.
    
    ```asm
    ; Pseudo-assembly for memory allocation
    ALLOCATE 64   ; Allocate 64 bytes of memory
    MOV R2, R1    ; Store allocated memory pointer into R2
    ```

---

#### **C. Instruction Breakdown**

The system breaks down each operation into **atomic machine instructions**. This is crucial for optimization, as it allows the system to process each command with the minimum amount of resources, leading to more efficient execution.

1. **Function Calls**:
    - A function call in high-level code is split into machine instructions for pushing arguments, calling the function, and handling the return value.

    **Example**:
    ```asm
    ; Calling a function with parameters
    PUSH R1        ; Push argument to stack
    CALL function  ; Call the function
    POP R1         ; Pop result from stack
    ```

2. **Control Flow**:
    - Loops and conditionals are translated into **branch instructions**, with conditions checked and jumps performed based on the outcome.
    
    **Example**:
    ```asm
    ; Conditional statement (if-else)
    CMP R1, 0      ; Compare R1 to 0
    JE ELSE_BLOCK  ; Jump to ELSE_BLOCK if R1 equals 0
    ; If Block
    MOV R2, 1
    JMP END_BLOCK
    ELSE_BLOCK:
    MOV R2, 2
    END_BLOCK:
    ```

3. **Optimized Loops**:
    - A `for` or `while` loop is translated into a combination of **comparison** and **jump instructions**, using registers to maintain loop conditions.

---

#### **D. Comment Generation**

For each transformation, the system generates **comments** that explain:
- **The purpose of the code segment**
- **The translation from high-level to machine instructions**
- **Any optimizations made** during the process

These comments will be **embedded** within the generated machine instructions, providing documentation that explains the logic behind each decision. This will help **human users** understand what each part of the code does.

1. **Function Header Comments**:
    - When functions are mapped to machine instructions, a block comment explains its purpose, parameters, and expected result.

    ```asm
    ; Function to calculate the sum of two numbers
    ; Arguments: R1 = a, R2 = b
    ; Returns: R3 = a + b
    ```

2. **Inline Comments**:
    - For each line of machine code, the system provides an inline comment that breaks down the instruction.
    
    ```asm
    MOV R1, a     ; Load value of a into register R1
    ADD R1, b     ; Add value of b to R1 (now R1 = a + b)
    MOV x, R1     ; Store result in variable x
    ```

---

### **3. Execution Flow**

The **execution flow** of ISES is as follows:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code is parsed to identify its logical structure (functions, variables, etc.).
2. **Scrutiny and Deconstruction**: Each part is deconstructed and mapped to machine instructions.
3. **Optimization and Command Generation**: The system identifies optimizations (such as eliminating redundant operations or using specific CPU features).
4. **Comment Generation**: After each transformation, comments are generated for human understanding and debugging.
5. **Output**: The system outputs the **machine-executable code**, along with **detailed comments** explaining its operation.

---

### **4. Example Workflow**

**Input Code**:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**ISES Transformation**:

1. **Input Parsing**:
    - Identify `def add(a, b)` as a function definition.
    - Identify the operation `a + b` as an addition.

2. **Scrutiny**:
    - The `add` function is isolated and will be transformed into machine-level instructions.
    - The parameters `a` and `b` will be passed through registers.

3. **Command Generation**:
    ```asm
    ; Function: add(a, b)
    ; Arguments: R1 = a, R2 = b
    ; Returns: R3 = a + b
    MOV R1, a     ; Load a into register R1
    ADD R1, b     ; Add b to R1
    MOV R3, R1    ; Store result in R3 (return value)
    RET           ; Return from function
    ```

4. **Comment Generation**:
    - Inline comments are generated for each machine instruction.
    
    ```asm
    MOV R1, a     ; Load value of a into register R1
    ADD R1, b     ; Add value of b to R1 (R1 = a + b)
    MOV R3, R1    ; Store the result in R3 (return value)
    ```

5. **Output**:
    - Machine code ready for execution, annotated with explanatory comments.

The **Imperial Superior Evaluation System (ISES)** provides an advanced approach to converting human-readable code into highly optimized machine instructions. By scrutinizing and breaking down the code, mapping it to intuitive commands, generating machine-executable keys, and providing detailed comments, this system aims to enhance both performance and understanding. This system bridges the gap between high-level coding and low-level execution, ensuring efficiency, readability, and maintainability.




Privileges: For most of these tasks, you will need administrator privileges to change power plans, adjust CPU settings, and access BIOS-level tools.
Ryzen Master: For Ryzen processors, Ryzen Master needs to be installed to interact with performance settings.
BIOS Configuration Utility: For HP laptops, you need the HP BIOS Configuration Utility (BCU) installed to modify BIOS settings programmatically.
This approach provides a practical way to manipulate CPU settings and interact with low-level hardware features on a Windows-based HP laptop with an AMD Ryzen processor. Direct manipulation of BIOS settings can often only be done using manufacturer-specific tools or through UEFI shell scripting in Windows.
